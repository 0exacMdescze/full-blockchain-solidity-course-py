ionCube PHP Encoder 9.0 272 is the latest version of the ionCube PHP Encoder, a widely used tool that allows developers to protect their PHP files with powerful encryption and security features[^1^].
  
With ionCube PHP Encoder 9.0 272, you can:
  
- Encode your PHP files with obfuscation and encryption techniques that make them unreadable and unmodifiable by anyone else.

## How to Use ionCube PHP Encoder 9.0 272?
  
To use ionCube-encoded files on a web server, you need to install the ionCube Loader, which is a component that makes the encoded files available to PHP[^2^]. The ionCube Loader is available for many different platforms, such as Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS[^2^].
  
To install the ionCube Loader on your web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the appropriate Loader package for your platform from [http://www.ioncube.com/lw/](http://www.ioncube.com/lw/).
2. Extract the Loader files from the package and copy them to a folder on your web server.
3. Edit the php.ini file (the configuration file for PHP) and add a line that points to the Loader file. For example: `zend_extension = /path/to/ioncube_loader_lin_8.1.so`
4. Restart your web server.

You can also use the Loader Wizard, which is a PHP script that can help you install the Loader automatically[^2^]. To use the Loader Wizard, you need to download it from [http://www.ioncube.com/encoder\_eval\_download.php](http://www.ioncube.com/encoder_eval_download.php), upload it to your web space, and launch it in your browser[^2^]. The Wizard will guide you through the installation process and provide specific instructions for your web server.
  
Once you have installed the ionCube Loader on your web server, you can start encoding your PHP files with ionCube PHP Encoder 9.0 272. You can download a free trial of the encoder from [http://www.ioncube.com/encoder\_eval\_download.php](http://www.ioncube.com/encoder_eval_download.php), which allows you to test the encoding and licensing features of the Pro and Cerberus products[^1^].
  
The encoder comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) for Windows and macOS, as well as a command-line encoder for all platforms[^1^]. You can use either of them to encode your PHP files manually or automate the process with scripting.
  
To encode your PHP files with ionCube PHP Encoder 9.0 272, you need to follow these steps:

1. Select the source files or folders that contain your PHP scripts.
2. Select the target folder where you want to save the encoded files.
